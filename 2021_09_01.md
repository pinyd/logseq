- This letter is hurting me to write, but so is my pain and disappointed that I received from you. We have always had our differences, but we somehow managed to get along when needed. Underneath of all the smiles, jokes and laughter was bitterness and painful experiences for issues that never talked about or got resolved. Things that you never said sorry for and that you wouldn't own up to. I'm sure I wasn't always the best uncle to you. I've had to build a wall to keep you and the pain you inflicted on me, out of my life, this is not what relationship is all about. After getting hurt and betrayed multiple times I must    let go of you both.
	- Directing to each of you....Sagi, I loved you so much, I was so torn when I had to leave to the US and leave you behind.
	  But this is not about me, it’s about YOU, and the way I have been treated for the past 7 or 8 years and it all started with you asking us for a loan and I told you that this will ruin our relationships, you insisted that..it will not, and here we are.
	  Then I text you few years ago, I think it was August 28, 2015 (per Lidar's request), that I would like to talk to you trying to rebuilt our relationship and your answer was "let me think about it and I get back to you within 2 weeks", of course you never did.
	  Next...We were driving home from the hospital after few days that Pnina was in the  hospital after having heart problems, and a call came in from Lidar ( yet again doing what she wants with no regards to what I want and asked of her not once or twice) and there you are. Showing up on the screen, a very awkward moment and very surprised to say the least.
	  I do remember that you apologized very briefly but never mention any resolution about the loan, not until we had a family conversation which Carmen said at the end…”we have some unresolved business to talk about”.
	  Pnina and I didn’t know what that meant and we tried to figure it out.
	  We thought that you guys are mad at us because of that loan.
	  We couldn’t wait longer so we called you after few days and asked Carmen about that and she said that she bothered by the unresolved issues and wanted to make good on your promises, but you didn’t even utter a word and taking responsibility or apologize for all these years. 
	  Lidar…where to begin? for few years you were able to play me as a fool, trusting that you really wanted to build a genuine relationships and at the end to find out that it all was a game you play and not just with me. That’s who you are and until you will be willing to take a good look at yourself, you will fool others until they will discover the real you, and trust me they will.
	  there is no need to go into details, since we already did that not too long ago. So I’m sure that you know what I’m saying. So, sadly and heart broken I say good bye and wishing you both all the best with your life. 
	  Piny.

- Lidar's Response
- פיני,
  בכאב גדול אני מבינה איזו טעות אני עשיתי שנתתי לכם להיות חלק כל כך גדול מהחיים שלי.
  נראה שרק מי ששומר מרחק בטחון מכם הוא זה ששורד אותכם.
- לידיעתך, מהמייל המכפיש ועטור שקרים שלך אין דרך חזרה ואני לא רוצה לשמוע ממך או מפנינה יותר בחיים שלי.
  שום דבר שאני עשיתי לא מצדיק את ההתנהגות הסכסכנית, הנלוחה, הנלוזה והעלובה שלכם.
- אני ממש מרגישה שאני צריכה לשמור על הילד שלי מפניכם, אז תתרחקו ממני ומעופרי!
- ממליצה לכם להתאפס על השריטות שלכם וללכת ללמוד איך משפחה מתנהגת, אולי ככה אתה לא תאבד את האחיין היחיד והאחרון שנשאר לך בארסנל.   בהצלחה.
	- אין צורך להגיב לי :) 
	  אז תרגיש חופשי לחסום אותי בכל המדיות, כפי שאתה יודע לעשות מצויין בצורה הפחדנית הזאת שלך.

		- Lidar,
- You just confirmed who you are; a narcissistic self absorbed human being who can not see her own short coming, and take any responsibility for her self. You are self centered that takes advantage of anyone including your mother, federal assistance programs and your ex husband. So you can basically live your life in comfort while others have to assist you financially and additionally take your anger. Google ‘narcissism’ or Trump, and you’ll see your self.
  Pnina eloquently spelled out in her email to you who you are in plain facts and yet you can not look in your mirror.
  We both loved you and Ofri and we always looked at our mistakes, that is why we reach out to you trying to repair our relationship and I share with you that I wanted to see Ofri like before, instead of giving us what we asked and letting us see Ofri, you created your own group and sent two pictures to shut me up, like you treat Dolev.
  When Ofri will grow up, he’ll find out the ugly truth.
  And maybe then you’ll have no choice but to look your in your mirror.
  P. S.
  Just to refresh your memory, here is Pnina's letter to you.

	- Lidar,
- I've stared at my screen for a couple of minutes now, wondering where exactly I should start. It's been weeks, and all my words still elude you when I'm speaking to you. It's like I'm talking, but you're not listening. So, on the off chance that you are listening to me this time, this is what I need to tell you.
- I have thought long and hard about our relationship.
- When we first met, I found you intelligent, loving, and adorable. You seduced me into believing you wanted my help, love, guidance, and for me to be your aunt. I, in turn, wanted you as my niece as I deeply longed for more family, and, of course, I knew that Piny loved you very much and wanted us all to build a loving, trusting relationship.
- For a time, you appeared to admire, at times even idealize me, and my goal was to return that to you because I loved you, and I wanted you to love yourself. However, as time went on, some incidents shouted in my mind, "NO, that NOT OK." And yet, I chose to ignore them. I wanted a family, so I pushed it down. Mostly, my gut told me that if I disagree or disapprove of what you do, it will fracture our relationship. So I chose to remain silent and continue our (almost) nightly conversations till dawn. However, the more we spoke, the more I noticed things that I found unacceptable. I also noticed that I was met with resistance or silence if I tried to discuss certain issues with you. So I dropped them and talked myself out of it for fear of losing the relationship.
- As time passed further, I began to question your authenticity. So I decided to pay more attention to how you treat other people. And what I saw gave me pause and gave me a glimpse into my future if I have a need, a strong opinion, or once I've outlived my usefulness.
  My antenna went up the first time when you chose to ignore mine and Piny's absolute declaration that we did not want to speak or have a relationship with Sagi. Instead of asking us if it's OK to call while he is with you, you dared to call us while he was sitting next to you without any for-warning. We were shocked and hurt when we answered your video call and had no choice but to be polite and speak. Doing so was an illustration of Lidar doing what Lidar wants without reflecting on how it impacts others and crystallized your priorities and motivations, illustrating your need to look good at all times—in this case, looking good as the peacekeeper to Sagi, with no regard to us.
- Then came the several occasions when I expressed that my heart breaks for Carmen losing her mom at such a young age. You responded to that not only with disregard; you had the "chutzpa" to ask me why I would feel bad about that and then stated (I am paraphrasing), "So what if her mom died young...look what I am going through...having to go through a divorce." I was shocked at your self-centered question and statement. Lidar, I went through four divorces, rape, physical abuse, and more, yet I could never imagine making such a statement by minimizing someone else's great losses and making my life experiences, particularly divorces, the most significant issue.
- And then came your work ethic. Your job and commitment were/are to be the so-called "shadow" to an autistic child. Which you get paid for. More important, her parents and the little girl counted on you to do so. Yet, instead of respecting and considering the above, you chose to park your car, clock in as if you're at work, which is totally unethical, and spent the entire time talking to Piny and me on the phone until it came time to pick up Ofri from kindergarten. In so doing, you were lying to your boss, betraying the little girl, her parents, and being unethical and irresponsible. On several occasions, piny and I asked you, "don't you have to go to work," and you stated arrogantly, "no, I'm covered." Guess that was a lie too. Because eventually, the school finally caught up with your unethical antics, confronted you, and forced you to stop.
- Then came your public attorney. You criticized and questioned her every move as if you are a legal expert and continually complaining that she is incompetent and unfair to you. Then, suddenly, when she got you what YOU wanted, you called us and boasted about how incredible she was. You got your needs met, and suddenly from the loser you tried painting her to be, she transformed into a fantastic caring lawyer, crystallizing how you view people. It's your way, or the person is rendered wrong or useless.
- Then came the numerous times you complained and demeaned your mom, particularly when she cut Ofrie's hair. Seriously? OK, so she made a mistake. But what about all the wonderful other things she does for you and her unwavering devotion to you. And what about the time you arrived late to a family gathering while everyone had to delay dinner and wait for you. Rather than taking accountability, you rendered them overreacting, and again, you became the victim of your mom being upset. And the time you chose to be a no show to Yodfat's family gathering due to your disorganization. Again, rather than apologetic and remorseful, you rendered yourself the victim and shared that you were upset with your mom's reaction. Dalia is a devoted mom, and you're fortunate to have her. After all, this woman still works hard so she can assist you financially. And helps you emotionally and will do all she can to ease your life's burden. She deserves better than how you speak of her and treat her.
- Then came Gonen. You often describe him as cold, primitive, and unsupportive. When we have asked you if you consulted with him about Dolev or Ofri, you coldly stated, "No! Who needs him, and I don't need him lecturing me."
- And when I asked why Yodfat is not on the Dermer group, you stated that Gonen doesn't want her on it and because she leaves the group often and then comes back when she is upset and that she is moody. You went on to described Gonen as being controlling and demanding and making her miserable at times.
- Then, a few weeks ago, when I was getting sick and lost my wallet, I said I think someone must have cursed me. You agreed and said it's not carmen, and with a smiling gesture stated, maybe it is Sagi that did. Your tone suggested that you spoke to him about me. Thus, you betrayed Piny and me by sharing what happened and betrayed Sagi by disclosing what he most probably said.
- Then the matter of Dolev. Earlier in our relationship, you told us that you are going to therapy with him because he needs to work on his issues. No mention of course, of your issues; after all, you are always perfect and the perpetual victim. But I digress. The point is that the one thing that you always stated, no matter what, was that Dolev was a good father. Ironically, until you realized and shared with us that if he gets Ofri in shared custody, you will not get financial support from him. And with that looming, he suddenly became the devil, the horrible dad. You'd rather deprive him of his son and Ofri of his dad for your financial gain.
- At no point are you willing to consider how that may affect Ofri. The fact is that, like it or not, Dolev is Ofri's father. As such, he deserves time with him. But, most important, as we stated to you (which started your anger at us) Ofri needs and deserves to spend nights with his father to build a connection and memories with him.
- Then came the day we were on video chat as you went to the market with government assistant stamps. Assistance for individuals/families that cannot find jobs and need this financial help to feed their families. Not for those who do not want to work. Additionally, they are available for buying essentials. You were buying diapers which are essential but then bought birthday candles, balloons, and toys which is a luxury.
- More disturbing was that when you left the supermarket, you got in your car and started crying. I asked you why you were crying. You said you were embarrassed that you have to pay with stamps. OK, I get it. But that's your own doing. You're not the victim. You have a choice in this. Get a job. You're young and healthy, smart, and there is no reason why you don't have a more serious job that would ease yours and, for that matter, your mom's burden. So your tears were and are due to a choice you're making. But once again, rather than reflecting on the truth, you, again, became the victim.
- Lidar, it's time to take a good look at yourself. Rather than taking advantage of a government system designed to help the genuinely needy, taking money from your mom, and lying by clocking into a job that you're not doing, take a look at yourself. It's time you took responsibility for your life and where it stands. It's time to grow up, be an honest, responsible citizen/adult, and get a job as everyone else does. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and being a victim.
- Bottom line, Lidar, you live in a world that is about you. And you have little consideration for anyone else's feelings, opinions, or needs. And that is what got us here.
- Had you apologized for not returning the call to Piny's as you committed to, stopped defending yourself at every turn to the point that I had chest pain, refrained from saying "WOW" when I shared my pain, and instead said "sorry," for NOT hearing us when we clearly stated that we do NOT want your defenses or to debate this issue further, we want a genuine "I am sorry" and your understanding. And instead, when we shared our experience and feelings, you dared to laugh at us rather than be apologetic. And further, insist you did not laugh when we both saw it on the video chat. Had you listen and heard our needs rather than deny and defend your action, we would not be here. But as I stated, in your world and in your relationships, it's your way or no way.
- So for the best, I'm going to have to cut you out of my life. I can't have your negativity and toxicity ruining my life and adding to the large amounts of stress I already face. I can't do it anymore. I can't smile at you while I wonder if you'll ever apologize or if you even think what you do is wrong.
- And, I do sincerely hope that life will enlighten you soon. But tragically, how you treat people shows a lot about the sadness and darkness you carry in your heart.
- I hope one day you will be everything you can be by simply reflecting honestly at yourself. You are intelligent and capable, and you are hurting not only others but yourself. But, unfortunately, nobody can create that change in your life but you.
- Pnina
