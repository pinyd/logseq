# Sagi & Lidar
- This letter is hurting me to write, but so is my pain and disappointed that I received from you. We have always had our differences, but we somehow managed to get along when needed. Underneath of all the smiles, jokes and laughter was bitterness and painful experiences for issues that never talked about or got resolved. Things that you never said sorry for and that you wouldn't own up to. I'm sure I wasn't always the best uncle to you. I've had to build a wall to keep you and the pain you inflicted on me, out of my life, this is not what relationship is all about. After getting hurt and betrayed multiple times I must    let go of you both.
- Directing to each of you....Sagi, I loved you so much, I was so torn when I had to leave to the US and leave you behind.
  But this is not about me, it’s about YOU, and the way I have been treated for the past 7 or 8 years and it all started with you asking us for a loan and I told you that this will ruin our relationships, you insisted that..it will not, and here we are.
  Then I text you few years ago, I think it was August 28, 2015 (per Lidar's request), that I would like to talk to you trying to rebuilt our relationship and your answer was "let me think about it and I get back to you within 2 weeks", of course you never did.
  Next...We were driving home from the hospital after few days that Pnina was in the  hospital after having heart problems, and a call came in from Lidar ( yet again doing what she wants with no regards to what I want and asked of her not once or twice) and there you are. Showing up on the screen, a very awkward moment and very surprised to say the least.
  I do remember that you apologized very briefly but never mention any resolution about the loan, not until we had a family conversation which Carmen said at the end…”we have some unresolved business to talk about”.
  Pnina and I didn’t know what that meant and we tried to figure it out.
  We thought that you guys are mad at us because of that loan.
  We couldn’t wait longer so we called you after few days and asked Carmen about that and she said that she bothered by the unresolved issues and wanted to make good on your promises, but you didn’t even utter a word and taking responsibility or apologize for all these years. 
  Lidar…where to begin? for few years you were able to play me as a fool, trusting that you really wanted to build a genuine relationships and at the end to find out that it all was a game you play and not just with me. That’s who you are and until you will be willing to take a good look at yourself, you will fool others until they will discover the real you, and trust me they will.
  there is no need to go into details, since we already did that not too long ago. So I’m sure that you know what I’m saying. So, sadly and heart broken I say good bye and wishing you both all the best with your life. 
  Piny.
